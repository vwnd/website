    <h2 class="text-4xl tracking-tight font-serif">I'm Victor, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹</h2>

    <p>
      I help architects and engineers design buildings using the next generation tools for
      architectural design. I am currently based in Copenhagen working with a global team at
      <a href="https://perkinswill.com" target="_blank">Perkins&Will</a> and
      <a href="https://shl.dk" target="_blank">Schmidt Hammer Lassen</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started my design technology journey through Computational Design using Rhino and
      Grasshopper around 2018. Since then I have transitioned to web development and building
      extensions to Rhino and Revit.
