    <p>
      I help architects and engineers design buildings using the next generation tools for
      architectural design. I am currently based in Copenhagen working with a global team at
      Perkins&Will and Schimidt Hammer Lassen.

      I started my journey in design technology through Computational Design using Rhino and
      Grasshopper since 2018. Since then I have transitioned to web development and developing
      extensions to Rhino and Revit.
